I'd like to create a cookie clicker game, using 3d primitive to run in playcanvas/


I'll help you create a 3D cookie clicker game using PlayCanvas primitives.

3D Cookie Clicker Game
Click to open code
I've created a basic 3D cookie clicker game using PlayCanvas. Here's what the game includes:
1. A 3D cookie represented by a brown cylinder that rotates when clicked
2. Basic game mechanics:
    * Click the cookie to earn cookies
    * Cookies per click counter
    * Auto clickers that can be purchased
    * Increasing cost for auto clickers
3. UI elements:
    * Cookie count display
    * Auto clicker count
    * Button to purchase auto clickers
    * Cost display for upgrades
4. Features:
    * The cookie rotates when clicked for visual feedback
    * Auto clickers automatically generate cookies over time
    * The cost of auto clickers increases with each purchase
To use this code, you'll need to:
1. Include the PlayCanvas library in your project
2. Copy this code into your JavaScript file
3. Create an HTML file that includes both the PlayCanvas library and your game script
Would you like me to:
1. Add more upgrades or power-ups?
2. Improve the visual effects?
3. Add save/load functionality?
4. Enhance the cookie model with more detail?

AD
I get an error, PC is not defined.

AD
Uncaught TypeError: app.setCanvasStyle is not a function
    at (index):43:13

AD
should we seperate the html from the js?

AD
ok, lets add some animated cookies for when cookies are being generated.

AD
im not seeing any particles, but there are no errors in the console.

AD
can we seperate into three files:
1) game logic (including game state)
2) cookie canvas
3) ui display

AD
Lets do some graphic tweaks. First, I want to particules to radiate outwards from the central cookie. Second, I'd like the uI to show up in the upper right corner. In the upper left corner, I'd like to see the title "Cookie Quest".

AD
ui is broken. There are no central cookie. Also, when I click, its the title that is selected.

AD
better but still broken. Cookies shows up, but I can't click it.

AD
I found that the console has this error
Uncaught TypeError: event.preventDefault is not a function
    at t.<anonymous> (cookieCanvas.js:156:19)
    at t.fire (playcanvas.min.js:6:10969)
    at i._handleDown (playcanvas.min.js:6:206308)

AD
Lets rename the cookie auto clicker to cookie factory. Is there a factory emoji to go with that?

AD
ok, I want the cookie to look more realistic. Maybe we can add a cookie texture? Can you generate it and give me the code change? Can we apply the texture to the particule?

AD
It's looking great. Two graphic bugs. First, the 3d canvas looks fuzzy, out of focus. Second, the cavan doesn't take the whole width of the screen.

AD
Uncaught TypeError: this.app.graphicsDevice.resize is not a function
    at CookieCanvas.handleResize (cookieCanvas.js:54:33)
    at CookieCanvas.initializeEngine (cookieCanvas.js:35:14)
    at new CookieCanvas (cookieCanvas.js:5:14)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:7:26)

AD
how do I deploy this game? Can I put it on cloudflare?

AD
Ok, can we seperate the code for the main canvas, main cookie and particles?

AD
can you start source filename with a lower case letter?

AD
Ok, I'd like to extract all the variable that configure game balance into a Json file. I would also like to create a rank ( level system ) where the player levels up when he reaches a certain number of cookies. It should take about 10 seconds to reach level 1, 20 seconds for level 2, 40 seconds for level 3, 80 seconds for level 4, etc. There should be 20 levels to start. That balancing should also be in the json.

    at new UIDisplay (uiDisplay.js:6:14)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:8:16)

AD
I need to change the other files (game and rendering) to also load from the config file. Also, I need the cookie to be facing the player at rest (instead of its currently on the side). Finally, I need a red button in the UI, similar to the buy button, but to reset the game. you can put it on the bottom right. Oh, and lets add instructions a bit bellow the cookie that says "Click on the cookie to make more cookies. Buy factories for passive cookie income." All strings should also be stored in the config file.

AD
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')
    at GameState.notifyListeners (gameState.js:60:24)
    at GameState.reset (gameState.js:82:14)
    at new GameState (gameState.js:5:14)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:6:23)

AD
Lower the instructions to 3/4 of the screen. Put the reset button at the bottom right of the screen. The initial rotation of the cookie is wierd. It should start facing the player, and always end facing the player.

AD
i like the new rotation, but the cookie resets position at every click. That's pretty unatural.

AD
are you not using the config file anymore?

AD
can you give me a fresh and complete cookieModel?

AD
ok, last changes of the evening. Can I have a save and load button, in between the buy and the reset? dont forget the localisation goes in the json.

AD
Can I have a fresh uiDisplay.js with the css in its own file?

AD
Ok, the load and save prompts are just small empty black boxes.

AD
save and load now just reset the game without warning

AD
ok, save and load works, but I don't have any notifications

AD
can you give me a clean uiDisplay and ui.css?

AD
Level up notification uses a different font form the rest of the application. Can you standardize it? Also, can you change the reset prompt confirmation to use the same stype as all the other notification.

Ok, we are continuing development of Cookie Quest, and HTML 5 cookie-clicker like game we wrote in another chat window. I'm going to upload the source.

AD
are we missing a file?

AD
Cookie particleis an old file. it was replaced by particlesystem.js. Which file reference cookie particle?

AD
Ok, now I have a big problem. On mobile (iphone), I can't click on the cookie. And the interface is takes way to much of the screen.

AD
on mobile, the instruction text needs to be smaller, and a bit highter, because the buttons are overlapping the instructions.
Also, in the game balance, the factories are not helping enough. They need to help in an exponential way, matching the increase in pricing.

AD
can I have a full gamestate js?

AD
Formatting is better, but touch still doesn't register on iphonee.

AD
cookieGame.js:4 Uncaught ReferenceError: CanvasCore is not defined
    at new CookieGame (cookieGame.js:4:25)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:7:18)\

AD
click works, but sometime it zooms in. is there something I can do to prevent it?

AD
can I have full version of the files?

AD
index, cookieGame and ui.css

AD
Formating is broken now. I do not like the changes. Can you keep the interface relatively the same. and please provide complete file

AD
those last changes didnt work well, I have no ui on screen and no error on console.

AD
I'm going to start again, can I give you a zip with the source files? or do I need to upload each file individually?

Ok, I need to disable zoom on mobile. Its most likely because of double tap, although there could be other behavior. Can you help with minimal changes to UI? Last time you tried, you broke the ui. And if you change a file, can you give me the full file?

AD
I still get zoom on double click the buy cookie factory button.

AD
how do I embedded Cookie-Quest into a different web page?

AD
Can you help me write the git hub read me page for this project. I'd like to include a description of it, plus instruction on how to run it locally using vite and any requirements it might have. 

AD
What functions are used to calculate how many cookies I should earn over time?

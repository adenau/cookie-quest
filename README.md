## Development Background

Cookie Quest was developed as an experiment in AI-assisted game development, with most of the code written through pair programming with Claude AI. The project demonstrates how AI can assist in game development while still requiring human creativity, testing, and decision-making.

Inspired by the original [Cookie Clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker), this project explores modern web technologies and game development patterns while maintaining the addictive gameplay of its inspiration.
